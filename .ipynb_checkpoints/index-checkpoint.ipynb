    "\n",
    "In this repository you will find 3 notebooks, one for each of the midterm dataset options. While your model tuning is apt to differ (maybe even be better) use these as a general guidelines and ideas in data exploration, feature engineering, and model tuning. Key highlights and notes are included throughout. In general, remember that your process should generally include the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Define X and y\n",
    "    * y should be a continuous numeric variable\n",
    "    * X should be a number of numeric features\n",
    "        *X features may need substantial preproccesing including:\n",
    "            * Transforming datetime values\n",
    "            * Normalizing features ranges/distributions\n",
    "            * Creating dummy variables\n",
    "            * Ensuring there are no categorical variables coded (misleadingly) as numbers\n",
    "* Train / Test Split\n",
    "* Fit algorithm on training data\n",
    "    * Cross Validation\n",
    "    * Feature Engineering\n",
    "        * Synthetic Polynomial Features / Polynomial Regression\n",
    "* Evaluate Model Performance on Test Set\n",
    "    * Repeat process with seperate train/test split; do results hold?\n",
    "* Continue feature engineering, tuning, etc.\n",
